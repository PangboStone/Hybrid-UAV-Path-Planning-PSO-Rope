This repository implement a hybrid path planning solution for transport UAVs.

## ‚öì Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust path planning solution for transport UAVs operating in low-altitude environments with complex terrain and obstacles. The algorithm is designed to:
1.  **Globally Search** for an initial, collision-free path using an **Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm, which features a dynamic, diversity-aware inertia weight to escape local optima.
2.  **Locally Refine** the coarse path from PSO using a **Rope-Inspired Model**. This model treats the path as a virtual elastic rope, applying tension and smoothing forces to iteratively shorten and smoothen the trajectory until it converges to a locally optimal state.
3.  **Ensure Feasibility** by continuously checking against a 3D digital elevation map and UAV kinematic constraints.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts

The hybrid algorithm operates in two main phases:

1.  **PSO Global Search**: A population of candidate paths (particles) explores the 3D space. An improved PSO algorithm with adaptive inertia weight and early-stopping mechanisms efficiently finds a general, obstacle-free route from the start to the target point.
2.  **Elastic Rope Refinement**: The best path from the PSO phase is then optimized. It is modeled as a series of nodes connected by virtual springs. The optimizer applies simulated physical forces (tension and smoothness) to pull the path taut, straighten unnecessary turns, and ensure it remains clear of obstacles. *Note: The full hybrid integration connecting PSO with the Elastic Optimizer is a key area for future development based on the separate modules provided.*

## üìÅ File Structure & Description

The repository contains a collection of scripts that handle different parts of the path planning pipeline.

#### Core Logic & Algorithm
* **`PSO.py`**: Defines the main `PSO` class, which orchestrates the entire optimization process. It initializes the drone, environment, and particle population.
* **`defParticle.py`**: Contains the `init_particles` function, responsible for creating the initial population of candidate paths between the start and end points.
* **`iteratePSO.py`**: Implements the main `Iterate` function, which contains the core PSO loop. This version includes enhancements like early stopping and dynamic parameter adjustment to improve search efficiency.
* **`update.py`**: Provides the `update_velocity` and `update_position` functions, which define the mathematical rules for how each particle moves in the search space.
* **`calFitness.py`**: Contains the crucial `cost_function`. It evaluates the quality of a given path by calculating its total length and adding a significant penalty for any collisions with terrain or obstacles.
* **`ElasticOptimizer.py`**: Implements the `ElasticPathOptimizer` class. This is a separate, self-contained module for local path smoothing and refinement.

#### Environment & Visualization
* **`defMap.py`**: A utility script to process 2D map images (like `.tiff` or `.jpg`) into 3D heightmaps. It uses interpolation to create a continuous 3D surface and can save the result as a `.vtk` file for 3D visualization.
* **`map_selector.py`**: An interactive GUI tool built with `tkinter` and `matplotlib`. It displays a 2D map and allows the user to visually select start and target coordinates for the path planning task.

#### Main Script & Demos
* **`Script_main.py`**: **This is the main entry point for the project.** It integrates all the above modules to run a full simulation: loading the map, selecting points, running the PSO, and visualizing the final 3D path.
* **`pso_demo.py`** & **`rope_model2.py`**: Standalone demonstration scripts used to validate and visualize the individual performance of the improved PSO algorithm on benchmark functions and the interactive behavior of the elastic rope model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Libraries & Setup

**Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  ```
**Install Dependencies:**
  This project requires several libraries for scientific computing, 3D visualization, and data processing. 
  
  ```
  numpy
  scipy
  matplotlib
  scikit-image
  scikit-learn
  pyvista
  rasterio
  Pillow
  ```
  Install them all using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
*Note on `tkinter`: The interactive map selector (`map_selector.py`) uses the `tkinter` library. This is typically included with standard Python installations on Windows and macOS. On some Linux distributions, you may need to install it separately. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, run: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.*

4.  **Prepare Data:**
    * Create a `map` folder in the root directory and place your map files (e.g., `Mountainous Terrain.tiff`) inside it.
    * Create a `3D Env` folder for storing generated 3D models (e.g., `.vtk` files).

## üöÄ Run and Test

The main entry point for running a full path planning simulation is **`Script_main.py`**.

1.  **Configure the Map:**
    Open `Script_main.py` and ensure the `filepath` variable points to the correct map file you want to use (e.g., `filepath = "map/Mountainous Terrain.tiff"`).

2.  **Run the Main Script:**
    Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python Script_main.py
    ```
3.  **Select Points:**
    A window will pop up displaying your 2D map, along with a separate input box. Use the map to identify your desired coordinates and enter them into the "Start Position" and "Target Position" fields in the input box. Click "Confirm".

4.  **Watch the Simulation:**
    The script will then:
    * Construct the 3D environment.
    * Initialize the PSO algorithm.
    * Run the PSO iterations to find an optimal path. The console will print updates when a new global best path is found.
    * Once the optimization is complete, a **PyVista** window will open, displaying the final 3D path.

## üìä Visualization

The project uses **PyVista** for high-quality, interactive 3D visualization. The `Script_main.py` script automatically generates a 3D plot upon completion, showing the terrain, obstacles, and the final planned UAV trajectory. You can rotate, pan, and zoom within the PyVista window to inspect the path from any angle.
