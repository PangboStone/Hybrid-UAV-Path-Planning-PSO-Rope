# Hybrid-UAV-Path-Planning-PSO-Rope
This repository implement a hybrid path planning solution for transport UAVs. By coupling an improved PSO with a rope-inspired convergence model, the algorithm generates smooth, collision-free, and dynamically feasible flight paths in challenging 3D environments created from real-world map data.
